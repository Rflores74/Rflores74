      I'm working in a tech company in which i'm learning a lot of new technologies, about cloud, clusterization,apification,etc. and i think it's really interesting as well,
      although is not exactly my cup of tee, i'm more interested in comunicative skills , desgin interface, or create good animations
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project, in which i could practise this new skill, because now, i'm just only stuongy, and i know that it's really difficult to change
